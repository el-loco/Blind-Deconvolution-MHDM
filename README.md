This is the code with which the numerical results in Section 5 of the paper "Applications of multiscale hierarchical decomposition to blind deconvolution” by S. Kindermann, E. Resmerita, T.Wolf and L. Vese were obtained using Matlab version 23.2.0.2409890 (R2023b) Update 3.To reproduce the results from Section 4.3 and the first part of Section 4.4 run the Matlab file test_noisy.m.  Choose the variable experiment either 1 for running the code with the observation f_1 or 2 for the observation f_2. The Code then produces a directory “single” (in case of f_1) or “multiple” (in case of f2) containing the images and graphics used in the paper. To reproduce the other numerical experiments run the following scripts in order  comparison_MHDM_variational.m , tables_comparison_MHDM_grid.m, non_blind_test.m, tables_non_blind.m. This produces the tex code for the tables in the corresponting Section. Attention: Very Long runtime! For additional Images and plots run the file make_plots.m.
